# Rewrites GitHub admonitions into mkdocs admonitions.
#
# This is because the README.md needs to use GitHub admonitions, while mkdocs
# wants its separate style when rendering. Only warnings and notes are
# supported by both flavors of admonitions.
#
# Input:
#
# > **Warning**
# > This is the warning text.
#
# > **Note**
# > This is the note text.
#
# Output:
# !!! warning
#     This is the warning text.
#
# !!! note
#     This is the note text.
