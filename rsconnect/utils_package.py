    Compare semver-like version numbers. This should be used for comparing Connect
    versions, but not Python package versions.

    This is a wrapper for semver.VersionInfo.compare(), but it can handle some version
    strings that are not strictly valid semver strings. Specifically, it can handle
    strings like "2024.01.0", which have a leading '0' in a version part. The leading
    zero in "01" makes it an invalid semver string.

    Note that semvers always have three parts, so "0.12" is not a valid semver. This
    function can be safely used for comparing Connect version numbers, but not for
    comparing Python package numbers, because the latter may not have exactly three
    parts.

    This function is better for comparing Connect version numbers than
    compare_package_versions(), because the latter doesn't handle the prerelease and
    build components of the version string. For "2024.01.0-dev+20-abcd", the prerelease
    and build components are "dev" and "20-abcd", respectively.
