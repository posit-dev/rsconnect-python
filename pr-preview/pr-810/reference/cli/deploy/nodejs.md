      Deploy a Node.js application to Posit Connect. The "directory" argument must

      JavaScript or TypeScript entry point.

    Options:
      -n, --name TEXT                 The nickname of the Posit Connect server to
                                      deploy to.
      -s, --server TEXT               The URL for the Posit Connect server to
                                      deploy to. (Also settable via CONNECT_SERVER
                                      environment variable.)
      -k, --api-key TEXT              The API key to use to authenticate with
                                      Posit Connect. (Also settable via
                                      CONNECT_API_KEY environment variable.)
      -i, --insecure                  Disable TLS certification/host validation.
                                      (Also settable via CONNECT_INSECURE
                                      environment variable.)
      -c, --cacert FILE               The path to trusted TLS CA certificates.
                                      (Also settable via CONNECT_CA_CERTIFICATE
                                      environment variable.)
      -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose output. Use -vv for very
                                      verbose (debug) output.
      --snowflake-connection-name TEXT
                                      The name of the Snowflake connection in the
                                      configuration file
      -N, --new                       Force a new deployment, even if there is
                                      saved metadata from a previous deployment.
                                      Cannot be used with --app-id.
      -a, --app-id TEXT               Existing app ID or GUID to replace. Cannot
                                      be used with --new.
      -t, --title TEXT                Title of the content (default is the same as
                                      the filename).
      -E, --environment TEXT          Set an environment variable. Specify a value
                                      with NAME=VALUE, or just NAME to use the
                                      value from the local environment. May be
                                      specified multiple times. [v1.8.6+]
      --no-verify                     Don't access the deployed content to verify
                                      that it started correctly. Implies
                                      activating the new bundle immediately rather
                                      than verifying it first.
      --draft                         Deploy the application as a draft and verify
                                      it, but do not activate it. The previous
                                      bundle will continue to be served until the
                                      draft is published.
      --metadata TEXT                 Include metadata key-value pair with the
                                      bundle upload. Use format: key=value. May be
                                      specified multiple times. Use key= (empty
                                      value) to clear a detected value. Forces
                                      metadata upload even on older servers that
                                      don't officially support it. [v2025.12.0+]
      --no-metadata                   Disable automatic git metadata detection and
                                      upload.
      -A, --account TEXT              The shinyapps.io account name. (Also
                                      settable via SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT environment
                                      variable.)
      -T, --token TEXT                The shinyapps.io token. (Also settable via
                                      SHINYAPPS_TOKEN or RSCLOUD_TOKEN environment
                                      variables.)
      -S, --secret TEXT               The shinyapps.io token secret. (Also
                                      settable via SHINYAPPS_SECRET or
                                      RSCLOUD_SECRET environment variables.)
      -I, --image TEXT                Target image to be used during content build
                                      and execution. This option is only
                                      applicable if the Connect server is
                                      configured to use off-host execution.
      --disable-env-management-node   Disable Node.js environment management for
                                      this bundle. Connect will not install npm
                                      packages. An administrator must install the
                                      required packages on the Connect server.
      -e, --entrypoint TEXT           The JavaScript or TypeScript file that
                                      serves as the entry point for the
                                      application (e.g., app.js, server.ts). Auto-
                                      detected from package.json if not specified.
      -x, --exclude TEXT              Specify a glob pattern for ignoring files
                                      when building the bundle. Note that your
                                      shell may try to expand this which will not
                                      do what you expect. Generally, it's safest
                                      to quote the pattern. This option may be
                                      repeated.
      --node PATH                     Path to the Node.js executable whose version
                                      should be used for deployment.
      -V, --visibility [public|private]
                                      The visibility of the resource being
                                      deployed. (shinyapps.io only; must be public
                                      (default) or private)
